ðŸ“„ Project Report: FinOps Dashboard for Cloud Cost Visibility
Name: Donakonda Sai Krishna Date: September 2025 Project Title: Building a FinOps Dashboard to Monitor Cloud Usage and Free-Tier Breaches

1. Introduction
Cloud computing offers flexibility and scalability, but managing costsâ€”especially under free-tier limitsâ€”is critical for individuals and startups. This project aimed to build a FinOps dashboard that tracks cloud usage and alerts users when services approach or exceed free-tier thresholds. The solution integrates AWS Cost Explorer API, Python scripts, SQLite, and Grafana.

2. Objectives
Fetch daily cloud usage and cost data using AWS API

Store and analyze data in a local SQLite database

Visualize trends and alerts using Grafana

Implement logic to detect free-tier breaches

3. Tools & Technologies
AWS Cost Explorer API: For retrieving usage and cost data

Python: For scripting and automation

SQLite: For lightweight local data storage

Grafana: For dashboard visualization and alerting

4. Implementation
Enabled AWS Cost Explorer and configured access credentials

Developed Python scripts to:

Fetch daily usage and cost data

Store data in SQLite database

Analyze usage trends and flag risky services

Created Grafana dashboards to visualize:

Daily usage trends

Estimated monthly costs

Alerts for services nearing free-tier limits

Exported dashboard JSON and captured screenshots

5. Challenges
Handling API rate limits and pagination in AWS responses

Integrating SQLite with Grafana for real-time visualization

Designing meaningful alert logic based on service thresholds

6. Results
Built a working FinOps dashboard with real-time data

Successfully flagged services at risk of breaching free-tier limits

Enabled proactive cost management and visibility

Documented the entire workflow and dashboard setup

7. Learnings
Gained practical experience with cloud cost APIs and data visualization

Understood the importance of FinOps in cloud governance

Learned how to automate cost tracking and alerting

8. Conclusion
This project highlighted the intersection of DevOps and financial operations (FinOps). By building a cost visibility dashboard, I developed skills in cloud monitoring, data analysis, and alerting systems. These capabilities are essential for optimizing cloud spend and ensuring sustainable usage.
